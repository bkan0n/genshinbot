# Noelle

Noelle is a Discord bot created for the @HMC GamerBr YouTube Community revolving around the game Genshin Impact.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A Discord Bot Token
- Python 3.13 (for local development)
- Access to a server for deployment (if self-hosting on a server and using GitHub Actions as CI/CD)

## Environment Variables and Secrets

### Discord Bot Token
The bot requires a Discord Bot Token to function. To obtain one:
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Navigate to the "Bot" section
4. Create a bot and copy the token

### GitHub Actions Secrets
The following secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository secrets for deployment:

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `SERVER_HOST_IP` | IP address of the deployment server | `123.456.789.0` |
| `SERVER_HOST_USER` | SSH user for the deployment server | `deploy-user` |
| `SERVER_HOST_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH private key for server authentication | `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...` |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub username for Docker registry | `docker-username` |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub password for Docker registry | `docker-password` |

The CI/CD uses two environments (production & development) with a single environment variable `TOKEN`. One token for each bot environment so that you can make changes to the dev bot before pushing to prod.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bkan0n/genshinbot.git
``` 

2. Create an `.env` file with your bot's token in your cloned repo. `.env` is included in .gitignore so it won't be published but always be sure and check that you aren't committing any secrets to GitHub.
```.env
TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxx
```

3. Ensure your Python virtual environment is set up.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the bot using Docker Compose. Ensure your TOKEN env var is set before running this command. 
   - You will receive a `"The \"TOKEN\" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string." warning if the environment variable is improperly set.`
```bash
# The docker-compose.local.yml looks for the .env file and injects automatically.
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build

# Alternatively, you can run the bot via Python, but you'll need to inject the environment variables from .env manually.
python3 main.py
```

## Code Style and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code checking and formatting. Before submitting any pull request:

1. Install Ruff and other dev dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
``` 

2. Run Ruff check:
```bash
ruff check .
``` 

3. Run Ruff format:
```bash
ruff format .
``` 

All pull requests must pass Ruff checks before they can be merged. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically verify this.

## Deployment Process

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment. Here's how it works:

1. Create a Pull Request with your changes
2. GitHub Actions will run automated checks including Ruff
3. All checks must pass before merging is allowed
4. The CODEOWNER, in this case [@tylovejoy](https://www.github.com/tylovejoy), has the ability to run `/dev-deploy` in the PR comments to verify the changes work without issue. 
   - If you fork this and want to self-host, you will need to change the github login name values in the deploy.yml workflow file (`github.event.comment.user.login == 'xxxxxx'`).
   - Be sure to change the .github/CODEOWNERS file as well.
### Deployment Requirements

1. The deployment server must have:
   - Docker installed
   - Docker Compose installed
   - Git installed
   - SSH access configured

2. Proper SSH key configuration:
   - Generate an SSH key pair for deployment
   - Add the public key to the server's `authorized_keys`
   - Add the private key to GitHub Secrets as `SERVER_HOST_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Security Notes

- Never commit sensitive information or tokens to the repository
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate SSH keys and access tokens
- Keep the deployment server's software updated
- Monitor server and bot logs for unusual activity

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure code passes Ruff checks and formatting
5. Submit a Pull Request
6. Ensure all checks pass before requesting review
